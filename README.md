# GameDB

A video game database for collectors, allowing you to digitally keep track of your physical collection, and have a slightly more organised grasp on your hording tendencies.

This project is built as both a website and progressive web app (currently only for iOS).

## How to run

1. Run `yarn` on the root directory to install dependencies
2. Create a file called `.env`, and populate with the fields from `.env.template`
3. Run `yarn start`

_This project was built by one guy in his spare time, for that one guy in his spare time. Feel free to look around, but currently this platform only supports one user. Me. Might that change? Maybe, but if I'm honest, probably not. This project was built to be secure using Google OAuth, but I have neither the time nor the energy to verify and maintain the level of security required for an open application. Plus I ain't paying database fees._
